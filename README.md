# Hurrigators Project

Hurricane tracking program using Qt and OpenStreetMap and NOAA data.

## Setup Process

Download the Qt Open Source edition installer [here](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer).
Check that you are working on an open source project, and that you are individual
Once you have reached the component selection screen, ensure you have Qt 6.3.2 and Qt Creator checked.
All of the other defaults should also be fine.

It could take >1 hour to download and install so get some popcorn.
